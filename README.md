## Description
- I completed the javasript code to enable the functions of creating a daily planner.
- It enables users to add and save events in the displayed timeblocks from 9am to 5pm.
- During this process, I gained an understanding for calling jquery functions, using dayjs and the local storage property to handle the functionality of a calendar application.
