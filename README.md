## Description
- I have developed a javasript code to create a daily planner.
- The planner enables users to add and save events in the displayed timeblocks from 9am to 5pm.
- During this process, I gained an understanding for calling jQuery functions, leveraged dayjs, and used the local storage property to handle the functionality of a calendar application.
